<h3><u>Call Centre Trends</u></h3>
<p>Created a comprehensive dashboard using Power BI to showcase the Call Centre trends and provide insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics. The dashboard highlights important aspects of customer and agent behavior, allowing management to make informed decisions. Here are the key features of the dashboard:

1. Overall Customer Satisfaction: This metric provides an overview of the customer satisfaction level based on feedback received. It is displayed as a score or percentage, allowing management to track customer sentiment over time.

2. Calls Answered and Abandoned: This section presents the total number of calls answered by agents as well as the number of calls abandoned by customers. It helps identify the call volume and the effectiveness of the call center in handling incoming calls.

3. Calls by Time: This visual representation displays the call volume over time, allowing management to identify peak hours and patterns. It helps in workforce management and resource allocation.

4. Average Speed of Answer: This metric represents the average time taken for calls to be answered by agents. It provides insights into the efficiency of call center operations and helps identify areas for improvement.

5. Agent's Performance Quadrant: This visual provides an analysis of agent performance based on the average handle time (talk duration) and the number of calls answered. Agents are categorized into four quadrants based on their performance, highlighting top performers and areas that need improvement.

The dashboard has been designed with an intuitive and user-friendly interface, enabling easy navigation and exploration of the data. The visuals are visually appealing, presenting the information in a clear and concise manner. This dashboard will serve as a basis for discussion with management, providing them with a holistic view of Call Centre trends and enabling data-driven decision-making.

By leveraging Power BI's capabilities, I have created a dashboard that showcases the relevant KPIs and metrics while maintaining a creative and insightful approach to data visualization.</p>

<h3>Customer Retention Analysis</h3>
<p>Dashboard Description:

I have created a comprehensive dashboard using Power BI to address the customer retention challenges faced by PhoneNow, the telecom company. The dashboard focuses on providing insights into customer behavior and identifying at-risk customers to proactively take action and improve retention rates. Here is a description of the dashboard:

1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): I have defined relevant KPIs to track and measure customer retention. These include metrics such as Customer Churn Rate, Customer Lifetime Value, Customer Retention Rate, and Net Promoter Score (NPS). These KPIs will help the Retention Manager assess the effectiveness of the strategies implemented and monitor progress over time.

2. Customer Analysis: The dashboard includes visualizations that provide a clear overview of customers who have recently terminated their contracts. This information allows the Retention Manager to understand the scale of the issue and focus efforts on retaining these customers.

3. Services Analysis: By visualizing the services each customer has signed up for, such as phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies, the dashboard helps identify patterns and preferences among customers. This insight can guide targeted retention strategies based on the specific services that customers value the most.

4. Customer Account Information: This section of the dashboard presents relevant customer account details, including their tenure as a customer, contract details, payment method, paperless billing preferences, monthly charges, total charges, and the number of tickets opened in administrative and technical categories. This information enables the Retention Manager to identify any potential pain points or issues that might contribute to customer dissatisfaction and churn.

5. Demographic Analysis: The dashboard incorporates demographic information such as gender, age range, and whether customers have partners and dependents. This analysis helps identify specific customer segments that may be more prone to churn, allowing for targeted retention efforts tailored to their needs.

The Power BI dashboard has been designed to be visually appealing and user-friendly, enabling the Retention Manager to easily navigate and interpret the data. The visuals are intuitive and self-explanatory, allowing for quick understanding and actionable insights.

In conclusion, this dashboard equips the Retention Manager at PhoneNow with the necessary tools to understand customer retention challenges, proactively identify at-risk customers, and implement targeted strategies to improve customer loyalty. By leveraging Power BI's capabilities, the dashboard provides clear and comprehensive insights into customer behavior and empowers the management team to make data-driven decisions for enhanced customer retention.</p>
