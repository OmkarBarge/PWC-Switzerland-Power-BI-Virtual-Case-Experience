<h3><u>Call Centre Trends</u></h3>
<p>Created a comprehensive dashboard using Power BI to showcase the Call Centre trends and provide insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics. The dashboard highlights important aspects of customer and agent behavior, allowing management to make informed decisions. Here are the key features of the dashboard:

1. Overall Customer Satisfaction: This metric provides an overview of the customer satisfaction level based on feedback received. It is displayed as a score or percentage, allowing management to track customer sentiment over time.

2. Calls Answered and Abandoned: This section presents the total number of calls answered by agents as well as the number of calls abandoned by customers. It helps identify the call volume and the effectiveness of the call center in handling incoming calls.

3. Calls by Time: This visual representation displays the call volume over time, allowing management to identify peak hours and patterns. It helps in workforce management and resource allocation.

4. Average Speed of Answer: This metric represents the average time taken for calls to be answered by agents. It provides insights into the efficiency of call center operations and helps identify areas for improvement.

5. Agent's Performance Quadrant: This visual provides an analysis of agent performance based on the average handle time (talk duration) and the number of calls answered. Agents are categorized into four quadrants based on their performance, highlighting top performers and areas that need improvement.

The dashboard has been designed with an intuitive and user-friendly interface, enabling easy navigation and exploration of the data. The visuals are visually appealing, presenting the information in a clear and concise manner. This dashboard will serve as a basis for discussion with management, providing them with a holistic view of Call Centre trends and enabling data-driven decision-making.

By leveraging Power BI's capabilities, I have created a dashboard that showcases the relevant KPIs and metrics while maintaining a creative and insightful approach to data visualization.</p>
